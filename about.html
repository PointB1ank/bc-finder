        <p>
	The battle cup finder was created to simplify the process of finding a party for the Dota 2 weekend battle cup. Currently the only other options are to use the in-game chat, which is a nightmare, or use the reddit thread which still requires you to scroll down the page until you find someone that matches your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
        <i><b>How often does the database reset?</b></i><br>
	Currently the database is wiped every monday at 5pm EST. Adding yourself to the list of eligible players for the next week can be done anytime after this.

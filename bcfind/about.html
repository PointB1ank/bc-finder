        <p>
	The battle cup finder was created to simplify the process of finding a party for the Dota 2 weekend battle cup.
             Being able to search for players that play a certain position in a certain tier has never been so easy.
            When your group is full, simply remove your post with a click of a button and prepare for battle.
        </p>
        <p>
        <i><b>How often does the database reset?</b></i><br>
    Any un-removed posts will be automatically removed from the database every Sunday so those who want to start looking for a group
            early won't be mixed in with people from the previous week.
        </p>
           <i><b>How does it work?</b></i><br>
           Your profile information: region, tier, steam url, etc. are saved permanently so you can re-list yourself every week with ease.
           Start by completing your profile, then click "Find a party". Fill out some additional information about your group and click submit.
           You will be added to the database and automatically appear on the player table.
